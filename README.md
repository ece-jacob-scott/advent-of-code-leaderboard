# Advent of Code Leaderboard

url: https://aoc-leaderboard.fly.dev/

This is a tiny flask app that allows a small set of users to upload their
leaderboards from [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/self)
and then there is a new custom leaderboard created with all the users. This makes
it so that you can have a local leaderboard and not compete on a global scale.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Github OAuth for login
- [ ] Leaderboard input validation 
- [ ] Add colors
- [ ] Create a video that shows how to get the leaderboard value
